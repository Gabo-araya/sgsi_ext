# Django 3 Project Templateâ„¢

### Devcontainer configuration

#### Shared configuration

The configuration files in your computer stored in `~/.local/share/magnet-django-devcontainer` are shared to all django devcontainers. This stores zsh and ipython histories, and other customizations.

In this folder, in `zshcustom/50-aliases.zsh` you may customize your aliases. This file is only created once (by quickstart.sh if it doesn't exist), and never automatically modified later.

You can add other `zshcustom/*.zsh` files, which are loaded when zsh starts. You can also add and commit `docker/zsh_dev/custom/*.zsh` files so they apply to all developers.

#### Disable IPython exit prompt

To disable `Do you really want to exit ([y]/n)?` prompt of IPython, run:

```sh
ipython profile create
sed -i 's/# c.TerminalInteractiveShell.confirm_exit = True/c.TerminalInteractiveShell.confirm_exit = False/' /root/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py
```

### Solving `poetry.lock` merge conflicts

If `pyproject.toml` is not conflicted, and the only conflict in `poetry.lock` is:
```toml
content-hash = "..."
```
you can solve it by running this inside the devcontainer:
```sh
git restore --staged --worktree poetry.lock && poetry lock --no-update && git add poetry.lock
```

### User Authentication
#### Inactive users
The built-in forms and views support displaying a message when their accounts
exist but were deactivated. However, the respective code paths won't execute
when using the default `ModelBackend` for authentication and they will be
considered as they never existed. This is a deliberate design decision by part
of Django developers.

If you really need to display such a message, consider using a different backend
for authentication such as `AllowAllUsersModelBackend`.

### Unit tests
Django 3 Project template introduces slight modifications to the already known
TestCase classes to improve performance. This also implies some considerations
when migrating code from existing Django projects.

#### Create test data in `setUpTestData`
Due to the way tests work, the `setUp` method is invoked before every test
method. That means if your object creation calls are computationally expensive
(such as secure password hashing) or require webservice or database access, the
execution time increases significantly.

In order to solve that problem and make tests faster, object creation is moved
to the `setUpTestData` method. Django runs `setUpTestData` along with fixture
creation inside a transaction. Your objects will be accessible from all test
methods within your class.

If you modify any object during a test, make sure you revert the changes by
executing `self.my_object.refresh_from_db()` on the `setUp()` method. While this
will imply a `SELECT` will be executed before each test, it will be faster than
creating the objects.

#### Mockup is now a class field
Mockup is now a class field, meaning you need to replace your existing
`self.create_*` calls to `self.mockup.create_*`.

### Javascript debugging

In development, webpack is configured to produce simple sourcemaps, because nice sourcemaps take too long to generate in large projects.

The downside is that for example when debugging in the browser the `render()` of a React component, it looks like this:

You can change, in `webpack.dev.js`, the `devtool` option so it looks like this:
