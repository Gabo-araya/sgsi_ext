## Deploy

The target server has to:
- be running Ubuntu 20.04
- have Docker installed
- be present in `inventory.yml`

To deploy for the first time, run:
```sh
ansible/deploy.sh dev
```
where `dev` is the name of the host in inventory.

For faster deployments after the first one, you may use:
```sh
ansible/update.sh dev
```
